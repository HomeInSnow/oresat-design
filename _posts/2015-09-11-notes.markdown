We started talking about power so we started with a Google sheet:  <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U0pZVYygCMxkPNdXr0VBEqq5KxYvYgUe8o8VVQBnHYE/>

## Goals

 - Minimize power and weight and complexity on the cubesat
    - Small, lightweight low gain ("bad") deployable antenna
    - No power amp, if we can help it.
 - Don't care about power and weight and complexity on the ground
    - Huge-ass antenna ("big ears")
    - Lots of power

## Radios

Base the design on the KW0x radio chip -- one on CS0, one on a receiver platform at the ground antenna!

- 17 dBm maximum radio output
- -105 dBm sensititivty @ 38 kbps (but BER = 10^-5 which is low)
- Ground needs power amp -- 5W output seems pretty reasonable
- Ground needs pre-amp -- +18 dB seems pretty reasonable

## Ground antennas

- Crossed Yagis
   - M2 Antennas 436CP30 - http://www.dxengineering.com/parts/msq-436cp30
   - 70 cm circular polar. Yagi with 15.5 dBic, 30 deg @ -3dB, N female, 5 lbs.
   - Whoah! It's 13 ft long! A apin to point, but who cares.

- Helical anntenna -- seems better (shorter, more pretty :)
   - http://www.i1wqrlinkradio.com/antype/ch30/chiave1000.htm
   - 430-450 MHz, 16 turns, 36 deg @ -3dB, 15.5 dBic, 2.8 m (9 ft) long (w/ 0.6 x 0.6 m mesh)

- Ground pre-amp
   - Advanced Receiver Research P432VDG
   - NF = 0.5 dB, +18 db gain, $90
   - Even better: MSP432VDG-25, which is mast-mounted and 16 dB, $190. Only 16 dB, but it switches automatically for any transmitter under 25W
