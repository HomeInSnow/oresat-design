## Friday 8/21 Notes

- 47 CFR 97.207 / 211 says:  144-146 MHz, 435-438 MHz
- SWAP: Size, Weight, and Power
- Why split the radio into 2m/70cm?
- NASA solution: Electra / Iris / Iris v2

- Requirements

- Behavioral requirements
   - No solar cells (battery charger fails)
   - Tumbling fast
   - Lipo fails, must be able to work from solar only: must be able to transmit beacon from solar power only given tumbling.

- Antenna

- 1/4 wave against ground plane
- 1/2 wave as a dipole
- Two phased dipoles at 90 degrees get rid of nulls from a single dipole
- Springs, tape measures, and interesting: v shape that acts as cubesat slides *and* as flip up antennas.


## Decisions:

- 70 cm -- no substantial gain to use 2m, everything is smaller, and since we have no multipath issues
- Half duplex is OK
- 3.3 ms to 1000 km, so comm delay for half duplex is OK (6.6 ms)
- As isotropic a radiator as possible
- Thinking of pi/4-QPSK but we don't know.
- Radio should be digital.
