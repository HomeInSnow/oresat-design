## Description of protocols used on CS-0

### Over-the-air protocols

* ___CW Packet Protocol___
   This is the Morse Code message beacon sent on the UHF-Band during 10 minute periodic telemetry times. This is intended to be received by the general public.

* ___AX.25 Packet Protocol___
   This is the AX.25 digital packet radio beacon sent on the UHF-Band using G3RUH modulation during 10 minute periodic telemetry times. This follows just after the CW beacon. This is intended to be received by the general public.

* ___Engineering Data Uplink___
   This is the data format of the engineering uplink sent on the L-Band for control messages. This is intended to be used only by OreSat.

* ___Engineering Data Downlink___
   This is the data format of the engineering downlink sent on UHF for control responses. The responses would include
   acquired data and more detailed telemetry. This is intended to be used only by OreSat.

   
* ___DxWiFi Uplink___
   TBD on S-Band

* ___DXWiFi Downlink___
   TBD on S-Band
