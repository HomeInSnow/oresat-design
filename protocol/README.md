## Description of various protocols used on CS-0

### Over-the-air protocols

* Proposed CW Packet Protocol
   This is the Morse Code message beacon sent on the UHF-Band during 10 minute periodic telemetry times.

* Proposed AX.25 Packet Protocol
   This is the AX.25 digital packet radio beacon sent on the UHF-Band using G3RUH modulation during 10 minute periodic telemetry times.
   This follows just after the CW beacon.

* Engineering data uplink
   This is the data format of the engineering uplink sent on the L-Band for control messages.

* Engineering data downlink
   This is the data format of the engineering downlink sent  for control responses. The responses would include
   acquired data and more detailed telemetry.
